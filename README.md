Zeckendorf
==========
A simple javascript program to illustrate the Zeckendorf's theorem.
According to the theorm ,every positive integer can be represented uniquely as the sum of one or more distinct Fibonacci numbers in such a way that the sum does not include any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

Eg:
100 = 89 + 8 + 3.
